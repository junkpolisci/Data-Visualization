```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

First, I need to load in the sample data. 
```{r}
install.packages("gapminder")
library(gapminder)
library(ggplot2)
```
```{r}
gapminder
```

Assign the data to an object, p. 
```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = gapminder)
```

Need to tell ggplot which variable takes x and y. 
```{r}
p <-  ggplot(data = gapminder, 
             mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, #This argument links variables to components of the plot. 
                           y = lifeExp))
p
str(p)
p + geom_point() # Up to now p was just a description of what goes where in the plot, the geom_ argument gives the plot its form. In this case it is a scatter plot. 
```
